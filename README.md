# Python-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project contains 3 python machine learning algorithms with the purpose of showcasing what they do and how they do it

The 3 algorithms used are:
Linear Regression: Using lily dataset it predicts the petal length based on petal width
KNN: Using dry beans dataset it attempts to classify different bean types based on variables
KMeans: Using dry beans dataset it attempts to classify different bean types based on variables (sounds oddly familiar)

How to use:
- Install jupyter notebook
- Make sure you have the following libraries
    panda
    matplotlib
    numpy
    sklearn
- Download files from github
- Click run
